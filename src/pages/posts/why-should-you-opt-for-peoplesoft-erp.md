title: Why Should You Opt for PeopleSoft ERP?
subtitle: >-
  For any company to reach its zenith, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is
  crucial. It facilitates the smooth workflow between the departments, and even
  between vendors and enterprises. When PeopleSoft entered the market, it was
  undoubtedly the leader in offering  ERP solutions in HRMS. The legacy
  continues even after Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2005.
